        When you create an arrays, you have to declare the length, otherwise it's
        impossible to create an arrays. Arrays are fixed in length.

        For lists, you don't need to assign any value, no limitation. No need to declare
        the number of elements in the beginning.
        Lists are flexible when it comes to length. You can add as many as you want and when you require.

        Comparison:
        Arrays are fixed in length;Lists are flexible.
        Lists can also store multiple data in the same data type like arrays.
        Lists store non-primitive data types, arrays cannot.
        Lists have many useful methods, arrays don't.
        Lists can't store primitive data types, it must be wrapper class of that data type.



        Then, why Java still keeps Arrays? Two reason:
        1. Arrays are fast.
        2. Arrays use less memory.

        So we can use arrays when we know for sure that circumstances
         are not going to change; they are constant.
