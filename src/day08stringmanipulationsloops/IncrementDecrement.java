//To increase by 1 has a specific syntax
//int m = 7;   ==> m++;   ==> m = m+1; ==>   m+ = 1; They are same. That syntax can be used only plus 1.

//Decrement means to decrease values of a variable
//1.Way: int i = 12;  ==> i = i-7;  ==> i=5;
//2.Way: int k=6; ==> k=k/2;  ==> k=3;
// i- = 7; same meaning
// k/ = 2; same meaning

//To decrease any value by 1 we have a specific syntax
//int m = 10; ==> m--; ==> m+m-1;  ==> m- =1; ==> They are same. That syntax can be used only minus 1.
